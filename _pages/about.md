I am post-doc researcher of the empirical macroeconomics group at the University of Salzburg, led by Florian Huber. I am part of the project [*“Analysis of central bank communication using advance text modeling methods”*](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/new-project-analyses-effects-of-communication-of-central-bankers-on-macroeconomic-behavior/?lang=en&pgrp=281990&pg=283628&is_paged=10) (ID. 18718) funded by the Anniversary Fund of the Austrian Central Bank. In addition, my project [*“Non-parametric volatility modeling in macroeconomics and finance”*](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/oesterreichische-nationalbank-funds-non-parametric-volatility-modeling-in-macroeconomics-and-finance-project-of-niko-hauzenberger/?lang=en&pgrp=281990&pg=283628&is_paged=7) (ID. 18763) has also received funding by the OeNB Anniversary Fund. The duration of this project is from November 2022 to October 2025. 

My research interests include: Bayesian methods applied to macroeconomic and financial time series, state space modeling techniques, parameter instabilities in predictive regressions of economic fundamentals, and modeling changing transmission channels of economic policy.
