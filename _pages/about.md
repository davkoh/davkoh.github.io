<p align="justify"> <b>About me.</b> I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the [Economics Department](https://www.plus.ac.at/economics/?lang=en) at the University of Salzburg. My research interests focus on the development of new econometric methods for the efficient use of Big Data with applications involving many financial and macroeconomic time series. Drawing on the literature on machine, deep, and statistical learning and Bayesian econometrics I aim to combine recent advances in (non-)parametric econometrics with multivariate time series models that macroeconomists commonly work with (e.g., vector autoregressions). My work has been published in the *Journal of Business & Economic Statistics*, *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, *Journal of International Money & Finance* and *Scandinavian Journal of Economics*, among others. 

I am principal investigator of the project [*“Non-parametric volatility modeling in macroeconomics and finance”*](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/oesterreichische-nationalbank-funds-non-parametric-volatility-modeling-in-macroeconomics-and-finance-project-of-niko-hauzenberger/?lang=en&pgrp=281990&pg=283628&is_paged=7) (ID. 18763). The main objective of this project is to develop techniques that can flexibly handle heteroskedasticity in macroeconomic and financial time series. In addition, I am also involved in the projects [*“Analysis of central bank communication using advance text modeling methods”*](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/new-project-analyses-effects-of-communication-of-central-bankers-on-macroeconomic-behavior/?lang=en&pgrp=281990&pg=283628&is_paged=10) (ID. 18718) and [*“Inference with Bayesian nonparametric models in the presence of measurement errors and outliers”*](https://www.plus.ac.at/news/oesterreichische-nationalbank-oenb-jubilaumsfonds-funding-for-project-of-michael-pfarrhofer/?lang=en&pg=220) (ID. 18765). All these projects are funded by the Anniversary Fund of the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB).

I have actively participated in knowledge exchange, providing scientific consultancy services to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Ispra of the European Commission, the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB), and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). My typical scope of activities in this context is to tailor econometric methods to the needs of policy institutions and central banks.
